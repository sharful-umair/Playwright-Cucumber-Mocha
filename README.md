# Playwright-Cucumber-Mocha

This project is a test automation framework built with [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/), [Cucumber.js](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-js), and [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/).  
It supports both BDD-style testing with Cucumber and traditional testing using Mocha.
